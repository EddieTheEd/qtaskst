# Qtaskst
A very, very lightweight task manager written in PyQt5.

# Running
*sys, pickle, datetime should be installed by default.*

```
pip install PyQt5
python main.py
```

# Packaging and distributing
Soon to be done! (For Linux, Windows)

Please note that just running the .py script is a lot faster than using an executable version.
